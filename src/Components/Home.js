          <h2>Understanding Tumors</h2>
          <p>
          A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain or central spinal canal, classified as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Benign tumors, like meningiomas, grow slowly and are often encapsulated but can still cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, or cognitive issues if they press on critical areas. Malignant tumors, such as glioblastomas, are aggressive and invasive, requiring intensive treatments like surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.
          The exact cause of brain tumors is unclear, but risk factors include genetic conditions, radiation exposure, and possibly environmental toxins. Diagnosis involves imaging (MRI or CT scans) and biopsies to determine tumor type and grade, guiding treatment decisions. While surgery is often the first step, complete removal isnâ€™t always possible, especially near vital brain regions, necessitating additional therapies.
